- 👋 Hi, I’m Shawn Vernon (@Incident8)
- 👀 I’m interested in Process Documentation, Woodworking, Model building, electronics, 3D printing, tinkering, Garage sales, social (human) responsibility, the gut biome, exercise, what we've forgotten and how it can be recovered and revamped for use now, and the meaning of realitiy (or the simulation thereof that we live in)...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that if you do what is hard, life will be easy but if you do what is easy, life will be hard (and more about automated testing, QA in general and always striving to be a better leader) ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on process flow, how to better handle the in person collaboration over telecommuting restrictions (keep that team involvement and spirit)...
- 📫 How to reach me incident8@gmail.com...
